Description:     Stormpath SDK
            -------------
        
            DESCRIPTION
        
            The Stormpath Python SDK allows any Python-based application to easily use
            the Stormpath user management service for all authentication and
            access control needs.
        
            When you make SDK method calls, the calls are translated into HTTPS
            requests to the Stormpath REST+JSON API. The Stormpath Python SDK provides
            a clean object-oriented paradigm natural to Python developers and
            alleviates the need to know how to make REST+JSON requests.
